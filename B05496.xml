         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Notwithſtanding whereof, there being a moſt wicked and ſeditious Pamphlet, Entituled, <hi>Jus Populi vindicatum, &amp;c.</hi> lately printed and diſperſed, containing and aſſerting pernicious and treaſonable principles, and falſe and ſcandalous aſperſions and reflections upon Our Perſon and Government, and the Authority and Proceedings of Our Parliament and Council, and juſtifying and vindicating the late Rebellion in the Weſt, and ſtirring up Our People and Subjects to the like practices, and containing other matters of dangerous nature and conſequence; which upon examination, is found to be a moſt ſeditious and ſcandalous Pamphlet and Libel, containing pernicious and damnable principles of Treaſon and Rebellion againſt Vs and all ſupreme Magiſtrates, and the rights of Monarchy itſelf, to the great hazard of Our Perſon and Government, and to the great reproach and ſcandal of the Nation and the Reformed Religion, if the poiſon of ſo horrid and deteſtable principles ſhould be ſuffered to be vented and diffuſed, by theſe who pretend to be of the ſame. Wherefore, We, with advice of the Lords of Our Privy Council, Do Ordain, That upon the twenty two day of <hi>February</hi> inſtant, the ſaid Pamphlet be publickly burnt in the high-ſtreet of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> near to the Mercat-croſſe thereof, by the hand of the Hangman: And do hereby diſcharge the importing, printing, having, venting, diſperſing, or concealing of that Book, or any other Books of that nature, or of the Authors and Diſperſers thereof; and Ordain the Acts of Parliament to be put in execution againſt all perſons whatſoever that are guilty, or have had, or ſhall have any acceſsion to the writing, printing, importing or diſperſing of the ſaid Book, or any other Book of that nature: And hereby Require and Command all perſons, who have or ſhall have any of theſe Books, reſiding beſouth the water of <hi>Tay,</hi> to bring in and deliver the ſame to the Clerks of Council, or any of them, betwixt and the ſixteenth day of <hi>March</hi> next; and benorth the ſaid Water, betwixt and the laſt day of the ſaid Moneth: With certification, that if thereafter any perſon of whatſoever degree, quality or ſex they ſhall be of, ſhall have any of the ſaids Books in their cuſtody or poſſeſsion, that they ſhall be fined in the ſum of the thouſand pounds Scots, to be exacted without any favour or defaul<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And for the better diſcovery of theſe who are or ſhall be guilty of the premiſſes, and for encouraging others to do their duty in that behalf, We do hereby aſſure and promiſe to theſe who ſhall diſcover any that art, or ſhall be guilty of ſelling or diſperſing the foreſaid Book, or any other Books of that nature, ſo as they may be apprehended, ſhall have payed to them the ſum of fifty pounds Sterling; and theſe who ſhall ſo diſcover the Authors or Importers thereof, ſhall have one hundred pounds Sterling; and if the diſcoverers be guilty themſelves, they ſhall have impunity granted to themſelves, by and attour the ſaid Reward, upon their diſcovery of any others guilty thereof. And Ordains the Magiſtrates of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to ſee this Act put in execution; And that the ſame be printed and publiſhed, that none pretend ignorance.</p>
